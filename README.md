# Analysis of running processes

why his program is not running the way it is meant to. In essence, the idea is
to build something that offers the same basic functionnalities as a simple
debugger.

## Building
Use the provided Makefile to build the projet:
```
make
```
Then run the debugger on your binaries like so:
```
./udb [OPTIONS] [FLAGS]
```
